			<div class="bio">
				Christopher is an aspiring full-stack web developer who helped jump-start EZPC Parts with the goal of
				learning and gaining experience in the general practice of software engineering and web development.
				With his love and passion for PC and building PCs. Christopher came up with the concept of creating a
				website that sells PC parts. After successfully building his first PC, he found that it was too time
				consuming looking for PC components that he needed, as there are various websites that offer only
				specific kinds of PC parts. Furthermore, it was difficult to track which parts he bought from where and
				had difficulty purchasing the parts he needed due to the many amount steps needed to take in order to
				purchase the product. Thus, EZPC Parts was born in hopes of making it easy to browse and buy
				products with ease.
